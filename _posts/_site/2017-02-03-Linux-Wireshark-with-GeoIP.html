<p>Perhaps I was missing something in the documentation, but for the life of me, I wasn’t able to find a guide on building Wireshark from source with GeoIP lookup enabled. Wireshark has <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/HowToUseGeoIP">great documentation on using GeoIP</a>, but the process of getting a copy of Wireshark with ‘GeoIP’ enabled isn’t spelled out at all. I assume this could be because certain packaged versions of it come with GeoIP enabled by default.</p>

<p>Needless to say, for those of us who are installing from the source package, you may find yourself baffled by the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">./configure --with-geoip=yes</code> continually showing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Use GeoIP library : no</code>. Clearly, we want the GeoIP abilities in Wireshark but a test is showing that we just can’t have it.</p>

<p>In the configure script, it attempts communicating with a C GeoIP library to test whether or not Wireshark can be built with GeoIP. Okay, this is a great hint. Searching, it seems that the lovely people at MaxMind actually <a href="http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/downloadable/#MaxMind_APIs">have a C API</a> for working with their GeoIP databases (I had known about the ruby gems, but not libgeoip). Sweet! Install their libraries (if you’re using Ubuntu, they actually have a PPA and you can install the library through apt) and then configure again with  <code class="highlighter-rouge">./configure --with-geoip=yes</code>. This should be your desired setup.</p>

<p>If successful, the output from <em>Help</em>-&gt;<em>About</em> will look like:</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful for anyone who is having issues getting Wireshark installed with GeoIP enabled.</p>
