<p>These are the notes and brief presentation from an IoT Network Analysis meetup at MakerHQ.</p>

<p>For those in attendance, there was a hands on ‘get up and running’ guide to using Wireshark. We used our recent home-built Arduino MKR-1000 based IoT device as a demo for reading the raw MQTT packets going across the wire.</p>

<p>The goal for the speech was to encourage builders of IoT products to use Network Analysis as a tool for not only inspecting possible data leakage, but also for general debugging purposes.</p>
