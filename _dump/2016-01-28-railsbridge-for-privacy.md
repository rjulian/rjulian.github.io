Last October, I put on a Railsbridge event at the Hacker Lab. It was a one day workshop for people to learn web development. Some incredible individuals put forth a bunch of effort to create tutorials at various skill levels that simultaneously challenged attendees while also giving them a sense of accomplishment as a reward fo completing tasks.

While not easy to set up, this is a great way to learn a new skill, especially one that seems completely foreign to you. I would love to do something like this in the guise of getting people knowledgeable or interested in the realm of security. That's a kind of tough thing to do, considering there're SO many facets of security to go over and the technical know-how needed can significantly vary from task to task.

The first thing I can think of is protocol analysis (one of my favorites!). I think the Holiday Hack is kind of a cool way in which you can embed various conversations in one pcap file and then have varying level of skillsets to decipher what info is correct and what info is dubious! Additionally, with packet capture, there're some really fun things you can do live. 

Another fun one would be for pen testing. I'm not a pentester by any means, but I'm sure there're some activities out there that can be constructed as a gentle intro to pentesting. What are the policy stuff involved (permission, whitehat vs blackhat, etc), what are the fundamentals of a pentest, and finally and most at length, what are the tools needed. All of this would need to be explained in a similar manner to the curriculum of noisebridge. 

I should start seeing if I can find someone else in the security community in Sacramento who would be interested in doing something along these lines.
